Excited to start the community engagement phase of our tool on [_Clinical Virtual Reality Training: Managing Chronic Diabetic Wounds in Regional Clinics_](https://www.dropbox.com/s/o5ybzhf5g9pl20p/VR_AHP_demoreel_FINAL.mp4?dl=0). In collaboration with the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute (SAHMRI), the University of South Australia, the University of Adelaide, and the South Australian Aboriginal Chronic Disease Consortium, we have developed a virtual reality (VR) education program for rural health practitioners focused on improving the diagnosis of diabetes-related foot complications (DRFCs) within the Indigenous community.

Great work, Stefan! Another important paper published [_Using Virtual Reality to Improve Classroom Behavior in People With Down Syndrome: Within-Subjects Experimental Design_](https://games.jmir.org/2022/2/e34373/). The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility and benefits of virtual reality exposure for people with Down syndrome in learning settings.

I co-led a Daily Moves workshop with Dr Raymond Matthews. The Daily Moves is a free supportive physical activity program for adults +65 years old. Dr Matthews discussed the benefits of napping and I presented the work from my Road Safety Teams' Glenelg project. After our presentations, Dr Saredakis, Mr Michalski and I showed the participants a few Google Map experiences in VR. They were blown away!!

I attended [_A guided tour of Practical Data Science with R_](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/events/list/2019/11/a-guided-tour-of-practical-data-science-with-r) workshop given by statistician [Professor Ernest Fokoué](https://www.rit.edu/directory/epfeqa-ernest-fokoue) from the Rochester Institute of Technology. The workshop was amazing, brilliant and definitely the most '_edutained_' I have ever been!
