I attended [_A guided tour of Practical Data Science with R_](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/aiml/events/list/2019/11/a-guided-tour-of-practical-data-science-with-r) workshop given by statistician [Professor Ernest Fokoué](https://www.rit.edu/directory/epfeqa-ernest-fokoue) from the Rochester Institute of Technology. The workshop was amazing, brilliant and definitely the most '_edutained_' I have ever been!
