# My Current Research Focus
On the following projects, I have primarily collaborated with incredible Adelaide researchers from [Behaviour-Brain-Body Research Centre](https://unisa.edu.au/research/behaviour-brain-body/) and the [Australian Research Centre for Interactive and Virtual Environments](https://unisa.edu.au/research/ive/).

Virtual reality sickness (or _Motion Sickness_) has plagued the VR industry since the early days. Improvements with device features such as field of view, screen resolution, latency, and tracking accuracy, have all made it possible for most people to better tolerate modern head-mounted displays.


Despite recent advancements with VR technologies, about 15-20% of people still self-report adverse symptoms from using head-mounted displays. Current research suggests that spending time in VR can result in changes to vision, cognition and balance. Hence, all VR device manufacturers have safety guidelines and warnings not to drive, operate machinery, or make decisions of any consequence until recovery.

It is not known whether a user can accurately judge subtle changes in depth perception, imbalance or cognitive processing which could put themselves or other people at risk. This research could have implications for how we understand aftereffects, measure VR sickness, and the safety guidelines for using head-mounted displays. The aim of this research is to better understand and characterise visual, cognitive and balance aftereffects and to assess whether these aftereffects can lead to negative consequences in the real world.

 A key assumption of VR training is that if a virtual environment mimics a real world training environment then people can learn skills and get better in the real world.

 In areas such as sports training and vocational training, the research testing this assumption is not yet established.

 After the Table Tennis study, Stefan was awarded a PhD scholarship to assess the effectiveness of VR as a tool to improve real-world behaviour and skills for individuals with intellectual disabilities.

An intellectual disability is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by significant deficits in intellectual functioning (i.e. reasoning, problem solving, planning) and adaptive functioning (social, conceptual and practical skills). Many people living with an intellectual disability are dependent on their families to help with everyday tasks requiring basic life skills. Learning how to look after oneself is an important step in developing and maintaining independence.

VR may provide a safe and repeatable environment for people with an intellectual disability to practice life skills. Furthermore, people living with an intellectual disability have been shown to learn better through practical hand-on activities and this is where VR is well suited.

<!-- There are few studies that have used head-mounted displays in this vulnerable population so it is important to tread carefully and be mindful that VR may be perceived as too sensory stimulating for some individuals. Like the general population, people with intellectual disabilities may also experience negative afterffects and may have difficulty expressing when they experience discomfort. -->

 <!-- The key objective of Stefan's research is to assess the effectiveness of VR as a tool to improve real-world behaviour and skills for individuals with intellectual disabilities. -->
