On this page, I wanted to highlight the three main research projects I will continue to focus on this year 2020.</p> <p>On the following projects, I frequently collaborated with fantastic researchers from <a href="http://www.cain.science/people">CAIN</a>, namely, Stefan Michalski &#40;my current PhD student&#41;, Dimitrios Saredakis &#40;PhD student&#41;, Dr Tobias Loetscher &#40;mentor and supervisor&#41;, and Professor Mark Billinghurst &#40;mentor&#41; from the <a href="https://unisa.edu.au/research/ive/">Australian Research Centre for Interactive and Virtual Environments</a>.</p> <h2 id=virtual_reality_aftereffects ><a href="#virtual_reality_aftereffects" class=header-anchor >Virtual Reality Aftereffects</a></h2> <div class=colbox-blue >To investigate virtual reality aftereffects on certain aspects of vision, cognition, balance and well-being.</div> <div class=row ><div class=container ><div class=left ><img src="/assets/BBBRC_3360.jpg" alt="" /></div></div> <p>Virtual reality sickness &#40;or <em>Motion Sickness</em>&#41; has plagued the VR industry since the early days. Improvements with device features such as field of view, screen resolution, latency, and tracking accuracy, have all made it possible for most people to better tolerate modern head-mounted displays.</p> <p>Despite these recent advancements with VR technologies, about 15-20&#37; of people still self-report adverse symptoms from using head-mounted displays. Current research suggests that spending time in VR can result in changes to vision, cognition and balance. Hence, all VR device manufacturers have safety guidelines and warnings not to drive, operate machinery, or make decisions of any consequence until recovery.</p> <p>It is not known whether a user can accurately judge subtle changes in depth perception, imbalance or cognitive processing which could put themselves or other people at risk. This research could have implications for how we understand aftereffects, measure VR sickness, and the safety guidelines for using head-mounted displays. The aim of this research is to better understand and characterise visual, cognitive and balance aftereffects and to assess whether these aftereffects can lead to negative consequences in the real world. <div style="clear: both"></div> </p></div> <p>I have had the amazing opportunity to work with <a href="https://visionsaeye.com.au/team/associate-professor-celia-chen/">Associate Professor Celia Chen</a> with her expertise in Ophthalmology. She has provided valuable insight and encouragement, particularly when I started down this path a few years ago.</p> <p>I have also been really fortunate to collaborate with experts in the VR field such as <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;cTZ7Bg8AAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;oi&#61;ao">Professor &quot;Skip&quot; Rizzo</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;6r77jtQAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;oi&#61;ao">Dr Brandon Birckhead</a> on our paper titled: <em>Factors associated with virtual reality sickness in head-mounted displays: a systematic review and meta-analysis</em>.</p> <h2>Transferring Skills Learnt in Virtual Reality to the Real World</h2> <div class=colbox-blue >To investigate skill transfer from virtual reality training to the real world.</div> <div class=row ><div class=container ><div class=right ><img src="/assets/RW_VR_TT2.png" alt="" /></div></div> <p>A key assumption of VR training is that if a virtual environment mimics a real world training environment then people can learn skills and get better in the real world.</p> <p>In areas such as sports training and vocational training, the research testing this assumption is not yet established. <div style="clear: both"></div> </p></div> <p>Starting out as an Honours project on learning Table Tennis skills in <a href="https://forfunlabs.github.io/ElevenVR.github.io//">Eleven: Table Tennis VR</a> and testing whether novice table tennis players got better in the real world, this research evolved into a key publication in its field and has garnered much attention.</p> <p>During this time, my research team and I had the exciting opportunity of working with Table Tennis Professionals, Paul Langley &#40;President&#41; and Kay Crowell &#40;Director&#41; of <a href="https://www.tabletennissa.org.au/about/committee/">Table Tennis SA</a>.</p> <h2></h2> <div class=row ><div class=container ><div class=left ><img src="/assets/BBBRC_Stefan2.jpg" alt="" /></div></div> <p>After the fantastic work Stefan did in the Table Tennis study, he was awarded a PhD scholarship to study his passion <em>Life skills training in VR for people living with an intellectual disability</em>.</p> <p>An intellectual disability is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by significant deficits in intellectual functioning &#40;i.e. reasoning, problem solving, planning&#41; and adaptive functioning &#40;social, conceptual and practical skills&#41;. These deficits can result in substantial challenges to individuals and their families. Many people living with an intellectual disability are dependent on their families to help with everyday tasks requiring basic life skills. Learning how to look after oneself is an important step in developing and maintaining independence.</p> <p>Typically, people practice life skills in the real world, but for people living with an intellectual disability their cognitive deficits may make certain tasks such as cooking potentially dangerous or impractical to practice in the real world. VR may provide a safe and repeatable environment for people with an intellectual disability to practice life skills. Furthermore, people living with an intellectual disability have been shown to learn better through practical hand-on activities and this is where VR is well suited.</p> <p>There are few studies that have used head-mounted displays in this vulnerable population so it is important to tread carefully and be mindful that VR may be perceived as too sensory stimulating for some individuals. Like the general population, people with intellectual disabilities may also experience negative afterffects and may have difficulty expressing when they experience discomfort.</p> <p>The key objective of Stefan&#39;s research is to assess the effectiveness of VR as a tool to improve real-world behaviour and skills for individuals with intellectual disabilities.</p> <p>Collaborations with <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;OF-YumwAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;oi&#61;ao">Dr Gun Lee</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;5xhD6NoAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;oi&#61;ao">Dr Jun Ahn</a> and <a href="https://people.unisa.edu.au/Caroline.Ellison">Associate Professor Caroline Ellison</a> have provided invaluable expertise from their relative research areas to the studies in this project. <div style="clear: both"></div> </p></div> <h2 id=sensing_reality_comparing_virtual_reality_to_the_real_world ><a href="#sensing_reality_comparing_virtual_reality_to_the_real_world" class=header-anchor >Sensing Reality: Comparing Virtual Reality to the Real World</a></h2> <div class=colbox-blue >To compare psychological, physiological and perceptual responses to real and virtual environments.</div> <p> There are several studies I have been involved in which fall under this project banner. Some of these studies are yet to be published, hence I will add more content here at a later stage and perhaps include some exciting new findings.</p> <div class=row ><div class=container ><div class=right ><img src="/assets/GlenelgET_scooter.png" alt="" /></div></div> <p>One of these studies that I would like to highlight is a usability study comparing how older adults experience real and virtual environments of the <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Glenelg&#43;Public&#43;Library,&#43;Colley&#43;Terrace,&#43;Glenelg&#43;SA/Jetty&#43;Rd,&#43;Glenelg&#43;SA&#43;5045/@-34.9803394,138.5133888,18z/data&#61;&#33;3m1&#33;4b1&#33;4m14&#33;4m13&#33;1m5&#33;1m1&#33;1s0x6ab0db1b0b87202d:0xa2fbf571af32052f&#33;2m2&#33;1d138.512106&#33;2d-34.979774&#33;1m5&#33;1m1&#33;1s0x6ab0db1c4c197483:0xef0daa3a714bb480&#33;2m2&#33;1d138.5168101&#33;2d-34.980204&#33;3e2">Glenelg Jetty Road area</a>.</p> <p>It has been an interesting challenge conducting studies outside the lab, but it has also been really exciting to try out experimental methods and new technologies in the real world. <div style="clear: both"></div> </p></div> <p>I should have some intriguing new findings and visuals to share later this year.
