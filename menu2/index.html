Improvements with device features such as field of view, screen resolution, latency, and tracking accuracy, have all made it possible for most people to better tolerate modern head-mounted displays.</p> <p>Despite recent advancements with VR technologies, about 15-20&#37; of people still self-report adverse symptoms from using head-mounted displays. Current research suggests that spending time in VR can result in changes to vision, cognition and balance. Hence, all VR device manufacturers have safety guidelines and warnings not to drive, operate machinery, or make decisions of any consequence until recovery.</p> <p>It is not known whether a user can accurately judge subtle changes in depth perception, imbalance or cognitive processing which could put themselves or other people at risk. This research could have implications for how we understand aftereffects, measure VR sickness, and the safety guidelines for using head-mounted displays. The aim of this research is to better understand and characterise visual, cognitive and balance aftereffects and to assess whether these aftereffects can lead to negative consequences in the real world. <div style="clear: both"></div> </p></div> <p><strong>Primary Collaborators:</strong> <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;fBU6ZDQAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;inst&#61;4953684370292535126">A/Prof Tobias Loetscher</a>; <a href="https://visionsaeye.com.au/team/associate-professor-celia-chen/">A/Prof Celia Chen</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;dDRkDXwAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;inst&#61;4953684370292535126&amp;oi&#61;sra">Dr Jim Saredakis</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;D0YnjCoAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;inst&#61;4953684370292535126">Mr Stefan Michalski</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;QWP9BCcAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;inst&#61;4953684370292535126&amp;oi&#61;ao">A/Prof Ross Clark</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;cTZ7Bg8AAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;oi&#61;ao">Prof &quot;Skip&quot; Rizzo</a> and <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;6r77jtQAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;oi&#61;ao">Dr Brandon Birckhead</a></p> <p><strong>Key Research Articles:</strong> </p> <p>&#40;1&#41; <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7145389/pdf/fnhum-14-00096.pdf">Factors associated with virtual reality sickness in head-mounted displays: a systematic review and meta-analysis</a>.</p> <p>&#40;2&#41; <a href="https://www.jmir.org/2020/10/e19840/">Exergaming with Beat Saber: An Investigation of Virtual Reality Aftereffects</a>.</p> <p>&#40;3&#41; <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber&#61;8827502">Beyond Feeling Sick: The Visual and Cognitive Aftereffects of Virtual Reality</a>.</p> <p>&#40;4&#41; <a href="https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/20/6817/htm">Rest intervals during virtual reality gaming augments standing postural sway disturbance</a>.</p> <p>&#40;5&#41; <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360100275_Getting_the_Most_out_of_Virtual_Reality_Evaluating_Short_Breaks_to_Reduce_Cybersickness_and_Cognitive_Aftereffects">Getting the Most out of Virtual Reality: Evaluating Short Breaks to Reduce Cybersickness and Cognitive Aftereffects</a>.</p> <h2>Transferring Skills Learnt in Virtual Reality to the Real World</h2> <div class=colbox-blue >To investigate skill transfer from virtual reality training to the real world.</div> <p> <div style="clear: both"></div> A key assumption of VR training is that if a virtual environment mimics a real world training environment then people can learn skills and get better in the real world. <div style="clear: both"></div> In areas such as sports training and vocational training, the research testing this assumption is not yet established.</p> <div class=row ><div class=container ><div class=right ><img src="/assets/RW_VR_TT2.png" alt="" /></div></div> <p>Starting out as an Honours project on learning Table Tennis skills in <a href="https://forfunlabs.github.io/ElevenVR.github.io//">Eleven: Table Tennis VR</a> and testing whether novice table tennis players got better in the real world, this research evolved into a key publication in its field and has garnered much attention.</p> <p><strong>Primary Collaborators:</strong> <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;fBU6ZDQAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;inst&#61;4953684370292535126">A/Prof Tobias Loetscher</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;D0YnjCoAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;inst&#61;4953684370292535126">Mr Stefan Michalski</a>; <em>Table Tennis Professionals:</em> Paul Langley &#40;President&#41; and Kay Crowell &#40;Director&#41; of <a href="https://www.tabletennissa.org.au/about/committee/">Table Tennis SA</a>.</p> <p><strong>Key Research Articles:</strong> </p> <p>&#40;1&#41; <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?type&#61;printable&amp;id&#61;10.1371/journal.pone.0222351">Getting your game on: Using virtual reality to improve real table tennis skills</a>.</p> <p>&#40;2&#41; <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.02159/full">Using Virtual Environments to Improve Real-World Motor Skills in Sports: A Systematic Review</a>.</p></div> <h2></h2> <p>A major focus of my research over the past two years is working on a project funded by SA Health.

Many people living with an intellectual disability are dependent on their families to help with everyday tasks requiring basic life skills. Learning how to look after oneself is an important step in developing and maintaining independence.</p> <p>VR may provide a safe and repeatable environment for people with an intellectual disability to practice life skills. Furthermore, people living with an intellectual disability have been shown to learn better through practical hand-on activities and this is where VR is well suited.</p> <p><strong>Primary Collaborators:</strong> <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;D0YnjCoAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;inst&#61;4953684370292535126">Mr Stefan Michalski</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;fBU6ZDQAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;inst&#61;4953684370292535126">A/Prof Tobias Loetscher</a>; <a href="https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user&#61;OF-YumwAAAAJ&amp;hl&#61;en&amp;oi&#61;ao">Dr Gun Lee</a>; <a href="https://people.unisa.edu.au/Caroline.Ellison">Associate Professor Caroline Ellison</a></p> <p><strong>Key Research Articles:</strong> </p> <p>&#40;1&#41; <a href="https://games.jmir.org/2022/2/e34373/">Using Virtual Reality to Improve Classroom Behavior in People With Down Syndrome: Within-Subjects Experimental Design</a>.</p> <p>&#40;2&#41; <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.627301/full">Vocational training in virtual environments for people with neurodevelopmental disorders: A systematic review</a>.</p></div> <h2 id=sensing_reality_comparing_virtual_reality_to_the_real_world ><a href="#sensing_reality_comparing_virtual_reality_to_the_real_world" class=header-anchor >Sensing Reality: Comparing Virtual Reality to the Real World</a></h2> <div class=colbox-blue >To compare psychological, physiological and perceptual responses to real and virtual environments.</div> <p> There are several studies I have been involved in which fall under this project banner.
